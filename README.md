# cuhHub - Raft

## ðŸ“š Overview
An addon that transforms the game into a [Raft](https://store.steampowered.com/app/648800/Raft/)-like game.

Essentially, you are placed onto a raft that other players will also spawn on upon joining. You must keep your hunger and thirst in check by retrieving food via activities like fishing. As for thirst, you must retrieve water from places like the ocean, although extracting water from the ocean will require you to filter it.

Threats like sharks present a danger to your raft too, so you must work to defeat such threats along with everything else.

This addon uses [Noir](https://github.com/cuhHub/Noir).
